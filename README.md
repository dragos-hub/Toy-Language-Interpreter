#Toy Language Interpreter
Designed and implemented a Java-based interpreter for a custom imperative toy language. The project supports variable declarations, arithmetic and relational expressions, conditional and while statements, 
file operations, heap memory management with reference types, and a garbage collector. The interpreter uses an explicit execution stack, symbol table, heap, and output list to model program state, 
includes deep-copy semantics for safe execution, and provides detailed execution logging and a text-based user interface.
